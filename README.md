# CopyMapsDestination
Adds an option to copy the destination on Apple Maps when in "directions" mode. A normal use case for me is opening an address with directions from another app, and needing to quickly extract the destination name. 

Available on iOS 10, and testing on an iPhone 7 plus running iOS 10.1.1.

## Installation
Make sure you have [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos) installed (guide found [here](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Setup)), with the `$THEOS` and `$THEOS_DEVICE_IP` variables configured.

After that just run `make package install` in the console from the project directory.
